# OneButtonDeepLearning
This repo provides the Graphic User Interface for Deep Learning models to realize "One-button" to use these models.
In detail, it provides plugins in [imagepy](https://github.com/Image-Py/imagepy) to run the DL models.

# Usage
Just copy the model folder, and place it in the imagepy/plugins folder.
Then the menu for this model will appear in the imagepy menu bar.
只需将要使用的模型文件夹复制到imagepy/plugins文件夹下即可。
（目前版本还未自动安装模型依赖，如遇no module named xxx，只需pip install xxx即可）
